# FOUDT: Flash of Unstyled Dark Theme

---

<Intro>
As many of us are embarking on the dark theme website trend, the popularity of building statically generated websites with frameworks like Gatsby and Next with CSS-in-JS is also on the rise. This has given rise to a new unintentional side effect â€” <em>the flash of unstyled dark theme</em>. Learn what it is, and how to avoid it.
</Intro>

!["DARK THEME"](/gatsby-dark-theme-lighthouse.jpg "Running a lighthouse test again gatsbyjs.org (as of 2020-04-02) reveals that the page has pre-rendered a light theme and then re-renders with a dark theme once client-side JavaScript kicks in")


## Naive Implementation

Statically generated sites are "pre-rendered" HTML files usually served from CDN. As part of pre-rendering CSS is also applied, usually with some CSS-in-JS framework involved. On first paint, the user will see a pre-rendered page. Once client-side JavaScript runs and detects the users preferred theme the page will re-render.

If the users preferred theme is different from the default theme, the page re-render will cause a "flash" between the two. I call this the naive theming implementation.


### Is this *really* a problem?

From a UX perspective, this is similar to other undesirable side effects like [flash of unstyled content](linkhere), or [flash of unstyled typography](linkhere). It might not be the end of the world but still very much noticeable. On a slow connection it can be very distracting and confusing.

## Improved implementation

The drawbacks of the naive solution is entirely avoidable with some basic usage of CSS media queries and global [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) (commonly referred to as CSS variables)

If you're just rendering the page based on user OS theme preference, this problem can *and should* be solved in CSS, not in JavaScript. Use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query in the `<head>` section of your HTML.

```css
:root {
  --color-fg: #000;
  --color-bg: #fff;
}
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --color-fg: #fff;
    --color-bg: #000;
  }
}
```

And in your React components do something like:

```jsx
// Pseudo code
const Text = ({ children }) {
  <P css={{ color: "var(--color-fg" }}>
    {children}
  </P>
}
```

Or if you're using good old global CSS, just do something like:

```jsx
body {
  color: var(--color-fg);
  background: var(--color-bg);
}
```

As we've now moved the theming logic to CSS, there should be no flash as client-side rendering kicks in.

One drawback is that CSS custom properties is not supported by Internet Explorer, but it can be [polyfilled](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/css-vars-ponyfill/).


## Adding more features

The global CSS custom properties solution works well for the simple use case of rendering a single theme. What about the more complex use cases?

### Alloa users to switch themes

A common feature is to allow users to switch between themes after the initial rendering. For this kind of interactivity we need JavaScript. That does not imply that we need React, we simply need an interface to modify the global CSS custom properties. Let's start with extracting our theme into a JSON structure:

```javascript
var themes = {
  light: {
    "color-fg": "#000",
    "color-bg": "#fff",
  },
  dark: {
    "color-fg": "#000",
    "color-bg": "#fff",
  }
};
```

Now you can add this piece of *render-blocking* JavaScript in your `<head>`

```javascript
// Get root <html> node style interface
var root = document.documentElement.style;
var darkMatcher = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)");
var prefersColorScheme = darkMatcher.matches ? "dark" : "light";

window.__onSetTheme = function () {};
window.__setTheme(themeName) {
  var theme = themes[themeName];
  Object.keys(theme).forEach(function(key) {
    // Set global custom properties on root element
    root.setProperty("--" + key, theme[key]);
    window.__onSetTheme(theme)
  });
}
window.__setTheme(prefersColorScheme);
```

This will set the color scheme for the initial render and also expose a global `__setTheme` function that you can call from within your React UI. You can also override the `__onSetTheme` to subscribe to when a theme change is applied.


### Persist user theme preference

The next thing you might want to do is to persist the theme that the user has opted for. A good candidate for this is to use `localStorage`. Update the `__setTheme` function

```javascript
window.__setTheme(themeName) {
  window.localStorate.setItem("themeName", themeName);
  ...
}
```

Update the `setTheme` function call to attempt to use the persisted theme first, otherwise pass the `prefersColorScheme`

```javascript
var savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('themeName');
setTheme(savedTheme || prefersColorScheme);
```

### Listen to thematic changes in user OS

As a last added bonus, we can listen to if the user changes the preferred OS color scheme. It can be debatable if the page should should change if the user has explicitly chosen a theme to use. I can see this being more useful for apps that always should adapt to it's surroundings like a desktop or mobile application.

```javascript
darkmatcher.addListener(function() {
  setTheme(darkMtcher.matches ? 'dark' : 'light');
})
```

Note: If you're using a pure CSS media query solution as outlined in the first improved example, you already get this for free without any additional JavaScript.


### Working examples

For the sake of this article I've put together two working demos to show how everything fits together.

- Next.js example: Source, Demo

## Summary

Hopefully you've now learned how to apply theming on a statically generated website built with React while avoiding the *flash of unstyled dark theme* side effect!
