# The Deceptively Complex Nature of Consistent Spacing in Typography

![Two ways of spacing typography](/spacing-type.png)

<Intro>
As a Software Engineer I feel there is a lot of misinterpretation and friction in conversations around typography and spacing. This article explores creating a unified language to create typographic harmony and consistency in the context of UI Software Design.

In this article we will attempt to narrow the knowledge gap between designers and software engineers.


## What is the problem?

The way that most projects are organized is typically that a product is designed in a tool like Photoshop, Sketch or Figma, and then interpreted/implemented by a Software Engineer into Web, Andorid iOS.

From the perspective of a Software Engineer, imagine your being handed over the following design specification:


-- Image of design spec --

## The bounding box

- Illustration that shows how it's affected by font size.
- Ilustration that shows characters that use the full bounding box (eg. chinese)

A unified language between designers and developers, where we use the same points of reference to create space around typographic components.

Given the importance of typography in software, one would instinctively think this to be a solved problem. Surely there is an established best practice here? I've been somewhat aware of the issue but also been too lazy to properly dissect it. However, as part of my current job I'm creating a Design System that will be used by many people. I can no longer afford to ignore it.


## Design and software divide

I've rummaged the interwebz for answers, and my conclusion is that there is still a knowledge gap between design and engineering. It goes both ways. Designers coming from a background in print design/advertising with a lack of understanding of the dynamic nature of typography in software. Likewise, software engineers with a lack of understanding about design and core typography concepts, making the assumption that is already a solved problem.


## Crash course in typographic terminology

To fully understand the elements in play, here's a quick crash course in typography terminology and core concepts.

Baseline
Cap Height
Languages / Writing modes


## The problem

### The bounding box dilemma

The text bounding box contains x pixels of negative space, this space is affected by the font size (and line height?) of the text itself. 

Let's begin with a simple imaginative design to engineering handover:


> Image of "photoshop design with text + button + paragraph" with guides and w/o guides


If this is just a static image, there is no way to tell the amount of pixels between the header and the paragraph, and the button at the end. 

Most developers here will make the mistake of measuring cap-height to baseline, this isn't equivalent of the spacing between


### Software !== Print


### web, iOS, android

### design tools, figma

figma auto layout
