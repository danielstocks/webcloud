# Typography and Spacing in Software

---

<Intro>
For as long as I've been working with Software UI, one of the biggest sources of inconstancies between design layout specifications and software implementation is the interpretation of margins around typographic elements. Why is this? And how can we mitigate it?

Given the importance of typography in software, one would instinctively think this to be a solved problem. Surely there is an established best practice here?

I've been somewhat aware of the issue but also been too lazy to properly dissect it. However, as part of my current job I'm creating a Design System that will be used by many people. I can no longer afford to ignore it.


## Design and software divide

I've rummaged the interwebz for an answer, and my conclusion is that there is a knowledge gap between design and engineering that goes both ways. Engineers have a lacking understanding of core typographic concepts, and are not paying attention to how type works in software. On the other end, we have designers who still treat software as a "static" medium like print, and very rarely design defensively but for pixel perfect implementations.

### Why is this even a problem?

Let's begin with a simple imaginative design to engineering handover:
