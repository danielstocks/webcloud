# Book Review: The Informed Company

---

<Intro>In this book, Dave Fowler and Matt David gives an introduction, advice around best practices, and provide a pragmatic step-by-step approach to start building a data stack as your company grows.</Intro>


The book unpacks the actual technology, methods and abstractions behind terms like *Data Sources*, *Data Lakes*, *Data Warehouses* and *Data Marts*. It was written in 2022 so it claims to have an up-to-date to current best practices and standards.

The introduction starts of with briefly explaining what data is and why you should care. It proceeds with explaining that a modern data stack consists of four layers of abstraction and it makes sense to start from the bottom and build up depending on your organsational needs.


## About me


I believe a book review is more useful if you have a rough idea about the perspective and understanding of the reviewer. As of writing I'm a CTO at a startup with roughly ~14 software engineers. I've built software for the web for 12 years and I'm in fairly fluent in SQL.

## My reflections

 These are all somewhat confusing words to me, especially since they commonly thrown around as buzzwords by bussiness who turn out to be clueless to begin with.



Summary:

I was quite suprised (and relieved) to find that 


WE can make data accessible, but what will the organisation do with it?


The true challenge lies i

They invent new buzzwords: Siloed Data., 



We started with google sheets and coefficient.


What's my experience?

I've had my fair share of writing SQL for backend web applications, and was curious to understand what these all mean and in what context they are used.


Theses are also words that seem popular to commonly thrown around by bussiniess without actualy. ABuzzwords.


A lot of companies talk about being data driven. 


For good reasons, but what does it really mean? Is looking at a spreadsheet 

What exactly is a data stack, a data lake, a data warehouse or even a data mart? Are they neccseary? If so, when, how and where?

These are all questions is had as i opened the first page in this book.
