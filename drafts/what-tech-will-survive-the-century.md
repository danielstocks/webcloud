# Which everyday tech products will survive the next decade

When I was a kid (1990's) there was a [frequent ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAd08c6rcLY&feature=youtu.be&t=138) on TV by a Swedish bed manufacturer. The ad featured a man lying down in his bed. Meanwhile there is a narrative voice explaining that most of the things in his home: The TV, Computer, Sofa, Kitchen, and even the Car, will be exhausted or rendered obsolete within five to twenty years. As the voice speaks, the actual things around the house start turning into smoke. The gist of it is that the company was offering 25 years of warranty on their beds.

Today there is a widespread perception that companies are purposely making things hard to repair. The norm in consumerism seems to be: wear, tear and replace. Also, at the pace of which technology is evolving, a lot of people (including myself) fall into the fallacy of feeling like we need the latest and greatest innovations to improve our lives.
