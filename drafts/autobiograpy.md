# A front-end engineering autobiography

As of writing (2019) I've been a front-end developer by trade for more than 12 years.
Even prior to my professional career, I was playing around with HTML, CSS and
JavaScript as a creative outlet. I'm only 32 but I already feel like an industry
dinosaur a lot of ways.

Having no degree or background in computer science to lean back on,
I've always had to work hard to stay on top of things in order to compete and stay relevant.

As I started out, most websites where still using tables for layout, inlining
JavaScript and CSS, using proprietary code or plugins (hello Flash and IE6).
In short: It was a inaccessible, incompatible and ill-formed nightmare. Worst of
all, most server side frameworks where like black boxes and gave us little or no
control of the output of HTML.

Thankfully there were champions of the front-end developer community, striving for
a more accessible, inclusive and productive way of building websites.
They advocated strongly for Web Standards, Accessibility, Responsive Web Design,
Performance, Separation of Concerns, but above all things: quality and excellence.
This was a guiding star and really inspired me to build better software.

At this time (around 2006) I would say that the number of companies I considered actually
knowledgeable and credible in regards to web development I could count on my two
hands. Most companies where still mostly back-end/enterprise shops with no
front-end developers employed. Funnily enough I still (in 2019) occasionally run
in to some grumpy .NET enterprise developer claiming JavaScript is not a real
programming language.

Fast forward 12 years, past prototype.js, jQuery, SASS, Backbone.js, Node.js, Ember,
Less, Grunt, Browserify, Gulp, PostCSS, React, Babel and so on...

I think it's pretty clear now that there is a culture divide in front-end
development. It stems from the idea that a lot the new tooling available in the
now JavaScript centric world of front-end development, is bringing us back to the
"Dark Ages" again. I'm sympathetic to that, because I lived through the dark
ages, and if they were to come back, I'd quit software and go into
gardening (I might do that regardless at some point).

I think the key here is being pragmatic. I see a lot of people who are
idealistic and would refuse to let go their point of view
